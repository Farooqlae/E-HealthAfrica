    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p class = ins>1. Rinse the rice in a fine mesh strainer under cold running water until the water runs clear. Set aside. <br>
        
    2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.<br>
        
    3. Add the tomatoes, chicken broth, tomato paste, cayenne pepper, thyme, and salt. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes.<br>
        
    4. Add the rice to the saucepan and stir to combine. Add the peas and carrots. Cover the saucepan and let the rice cook over low heat for about 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the liquid has been absorbed.<br>
        
    5. Serve the jollof rice hot, garnished with fresh parsley if desired. Enjoy!</p>
    <h3 id="ghana">Shito</h3>
    <p class = para >Shito is a delicious hot pepper sauce prepared with dried fish and prawns along with onions, chilli, garlic, and some spices. This dark coloured Ghanaian sauce has a rich umami taste which just makes everything taste better.

        Ghana shito is a very versatile. In the local Ghanaian cuisine, it is used in ways similar to a chilli sauce or ketchup. It can be used as a side, dip or even dressing. It is traditionally eaten with kenkey, waakye, banku and many other Ghanaian dishes. However, it tastes amazing spread on bread, in a stir-fry or salad, stirred into pasta; on barbecue meat, fish or vegetables; anything really.
        
        This Ghanaian sauce is rich and aromatic, with intense flavours; so, a little of it goes a long way to enhance food. It is a good way to eat flavoursome food on the cheap. I was thinking back to my student days and how shito sauce would have been useful for when I was broke! If only I knew about it then.</p>
