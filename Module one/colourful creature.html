        Zebras are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats.
            There are three living species: the Grévy's zebra, plains zebra, and the 
            mountain zebra. Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, 
            the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae.</p>

        <p>Zebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. They are preyed on mainly by lions and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick. Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and their young or foals; while Grévy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds. In harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while male Grévy's zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is promiscuous. Zebras communicate with various vocalisations, body postures and facial expressions. Social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras.</p>
